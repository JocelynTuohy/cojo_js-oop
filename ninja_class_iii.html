    <h1>Assignment: Ninja Class III</h1>
    <script>
      // Part I
      // Recreate the base Ninja class from scratch using ES6 classes. Your Ninja needs the following attributes:

      // name
      // health
      // speed
      // strength
      // Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default.

      // The Ninja class should have the following methods:

      // sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
      // showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
      // drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja
      class Ninja {
        constructor(name, health=100, speed=3, strength=3){
          this.name = name;
          this.health = health;
          this.speed = speed;
          this.strength = strength;
        }
        sayName(){
          console.log(`My name is ${this.name}!`);
          return this;
        }
        showStats(){
          console.log(`Strength: ${this.strength}, Speed: ${this
          .speed}, Health: ${this.health}`);
          return this;
        }
        drinkSake(){
          this.health += 10;
          return this;
        }
      }
      // Part II - Sensei Class
      // Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. A Sensei should have 200
      // Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength by default. In addition, a Sensei should have
      // a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10. Finally, add the
      // speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method from the
      // Ninja class, before console.logging a wise message.
      class Sensei extends Ninja {
        constructor(name, health=200, speed=10, strength=10, wisdom=10){
          super(name, health, speed, strength);
          this.wisdom = wisdom;
        }
        speakWisdom(){
          this.drinkSake();
          console.log('Any plan is bad that cannot be changed.');
